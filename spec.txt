Field specific rules:

 * If email is the same, last name is the same, the first name
   is different, and the first three letters of the first name are
   different:

   * If neither first name has an &, put both first names together

   * If one first name has an ampersand but the other doesn't, use
     that one

   * If both have ampersand - leave as conflict

 * If the last name is the same, the first name is different, and the
   first three letters of the first name are the same and the records
   share either an email address, phone number or postal address, then:
   choose the longer first name:

 * If email is the same and last name is different, don't merge.

 * If external id is in conflict, choose the external id that is
   higher, unless it is between 7 million and 9 million, in which case
   choose the lower one.

 * If start date is in conflict, choose the earlier one.

 * If each contact has an address, only allow one address in the 
   resulting record. It should be chosen by:

   * If one is complete and the other is incomplete, choose the complete
     address. Done.

   * If one is associated with a contribution or a contribution more
     recent than the other, choose the most recent contribution. Done.

   * If one is associated with a later start date, choose the one with
     the later start date.
   
   * If no rule matches, keep both addresses. One will be the primary, the
     other will not as chosen by the database.

 * If we choose a winning address, update all voter info records to be
   the value of the winner.

 * Merge all communications preferences. 

   * Privacy fields: if one record has a privacy field enabled, then
     it will be enabled in merged record.

   * Communications preferences: If one record has a communication
     preference set, it will be set in merged record.

Dominant rules: these rules determine whether one record can overwrite
all fields in the other record that are still in conflict:

 * If one contact has more contributions than the others, then it wins.
   Done.

 * If one record one the external id test above, then that one wins.

 * If we still don't have a winner, don't merge.
